does fileservice need secretid and vaultid?
does it even need a approle for reading anything in the vault? if yes(only read)

needs anonymization and deletion button

upon click of anonymization:
first confirm that the user really wants to do it, and be clear
that the account will be unusable after anonymization,
and that you will be logged out after clicking the button,
after confirming, scramble all data completely.
with no relation to the user at all. scramble it all.
or rather, generate something random to replace it.
then log the user out, and throw him back to homepage.


for deletion, same info of it being unusable and unrecoverable,
then wipe the database of every last bit of information we have of the user
and then throw him back to the homepage logged out.

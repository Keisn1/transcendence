gdpr:

made a template for gdpr plugin.
it still needs
 - 2fa check
 - frontend
 - db connection
 - actual testing


GDPR compliance:

in user settings, privacy tab.

user has the rights to know what data is stored, and for how long // read up on it.

-username
-email
-passwordhash
-2fa secret
-stats of games played for example


needs anonymization and deletion button

upon click of anonymization:
first confirm that the user really wants to do it, and be clear
that the account will be unusable after anonymization,
and that you will be logged out after clicking the button,
after confirming, scramble all data completely.
with no relation to the user at all. scramble it all.
or rather, generate something random to replace it.
then log the user out, and throw him back to homepage.


for deletion, same info of it being unusable and unrecoverable,
then wipe the database of every last bit of information we have of the user
and then throw him back to the homepage logged out.

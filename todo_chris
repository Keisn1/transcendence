gdpr:

made a template for gdpr plugin.
it still needs
 - 2fa check
 - frontend
 - db connection
 - actual testing


GDPR compliance:

in user settings, privacy tab.

user has the rights to know what data is stored, and for how long // read up on it.

-username
-email
-passwordhash
-2fa secret
-stats of games played for example

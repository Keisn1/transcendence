#+title: Todo New

- [X] Disabling to press enable2FA multiple times
- [X] disable enable2FA if the user has it already enabled
- [X] twofa_enabled should have a default value of "false"
- [X] add 2faEnabled attribute on user
- [X] what happens if the process is aborted?
  - 2fa secret gets created but it is not used since it is still disabled
  - clicking enable 2fa again after the user navigated somewhere else will just create another secret
- [X] do authorization in updateUser/updateProfile
  - find a way that only the actual user can change its data
- [X] actually implement 2fa verification (in login / disable and register)
- [X] implement disable-2fa verification
- [X] make better updateProfile (everything)

- [ ] implement "api/auth/verify" (something like that)
  - [ ] this is for the tournament
  - [ ] also will use 2fa

- [ ] change prefix for updateProfile
- [ ] grey line on tournamentCreationPanel

- [ ] bug: once 2fa is verified with wrong code, it is not working anymore (at least in tournament)
  - in login view it seems to work
- [ ] proper return schema for postMatch
- [ ] make email and username changeable in profile
- [ ] add statistics in profile
- [ ] add match history view
  - [ ] make the matchHistory link visible in profile
  - [ ] when clicking on a user in matchView or tournamentView or in the matchHistoryView, it should lead to the match history of that user

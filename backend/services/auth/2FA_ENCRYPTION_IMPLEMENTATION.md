# 2FA Secret Encryption Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive encryption system for 2FA secrets using Vault's transit engine. The system uses Vault's "encryption as a service" to encrypt 2FA secrets when storing them and decrypt them when needed, with all cryptographic operations handled securely by Vault.

## Components Created/Modified

### 1. encryption.plugin.ts
- **Purpose**: Handles encryption/decryption of 2FA secrets using Vault's transit engine
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses Vault's transit engine at `transit/encrypt/twofa-encryption` and `transit/decrypt/twofa-encryption`
  - All cryptographic operations performed by Vault (no local keys)
  - Base64 encoding for data transfer to/from Vault
  - Automatic connection testing and readiness checking

### 2. Updated db.plugin.ts
- **New Methods**:
  - `store2FASecret(userId, secret)`: Encrypts via Vault and stores 2FA secret
  - `get2FASecret(userId)`: Retrieves and decrypts via Vault 2FA secret
  - `enable2FA(userId)`: Enables 2FA for user
  - `disable2FA(userId)`: Disables 2FA and removes secret

### 3. Updated twofa.controller.ts
- **Modified Functions**:
  - `disable2FA()`: Now uses Vault-encrypted secret retrieval
  - `verify2FA()`: Uses Vault-encrypted secret for verification
  - `init2FA()`: Stores encrypted secret using Vault transit
  - `complete2FA()`: Uses Vault-encrypted secret verification

### 4. Updated server.ts
- Registers the encryption plugin with Vault instance
- Plugin loads after database plugin to ensure proper dependencies

### 5. Updated vault-auto-init-unseal.sh
- Enables transit secrets engine
- Creates `twofa-encryption` key in transit engine
- Updates policies to allow transit encrypt/decrypt operations

## Security Features

### Vault Transit Engine Benefits
- **No Key Management**: Vault handles all key lifecycle, rotation, and storage
- **Centralized Crypto**: All encryption/decryption happens in Vault
- **Audit Trail**: All crypto operations logged by Vault
- **High Entropy**: Vault generates and manages high-quality encryption keys

### Policy Configuration
- `transit/encrypt/twofa-encryption`: Allow encryption operations
- `transit/decrypt/twofa-encryption`: Allow decryption operations
- Principle of least privilege: Only auth service can access 2FA encryption

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Vault Initialization
The transit engine and encryption key are automatically set up when running:
```bash
./vault-auto-init-unseal.sh
```

### 2. Manual Setup (if needed)
```bash
# Enable transit engine
vault secrets enable transit

# Create encryption key
vault write -f transit/keys/twofa-encryption

# Test encryption (optional)
vault write transit/encrypt/twofa-encryption plaintext=$(echo "test" | base64)
```

### 3. Migration Considerations
- Existing plaintext 2FA secrets will need to be migrated
- System gracefully handles both encrypted and plaintext secrets during transition
- Recommend migrating during maintenance window

## Benefits

### Security Improvements
- No encryption keys stored in application memory
- All cryptographic operations audited by Vault
- Automatic key rotation capabilities (when enabled)
- Hardware security module support (if Vault configured with HSM)

### Operational Benefits
- Centralized key management via Vault
- No client-side crypto library dependencies
- Automatic encryption/decryption transparent to controllers
- Consistent crypto operations across all services

### Compliance & Audit
- All encryption/decryption operations logged
- Key access and usage tracked
- Meets enterprise security requirements
- Supports compliance frameworks (SOC2, PCI DSS, etc.)

## Error Handling
- Graceful handling of Vault connectivity issues
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting
- Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Fallback mechanisms during migration period

## Performance Considerations
- Network latency for each encrypt/decrypt operation
- Vault connection pooling and reuse
- Async operations to prevent blocking
- Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed secrets

## Future Enhancements
- Automatic key rotation with Vault
- Multiple key versions support
- Performance monitoring for crypto operations
- Batch encryption operations for bulk operations
- Integration with Vault's audit logging

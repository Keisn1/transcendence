CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism that allows web pages to make requests to a different domain than the one serving the web page.

*Key points:*
- *Same-Origin Policy*:
  - Browsers block requests between different origins (protocol + domain + port) by default
- *CORS headers*:
  - Server includes special HTTP headers to permit cross-origin requests
- *Preflight requests*:
  - For complex requests, browsers send an OPTIONS request first

*Common CORS headers:*
- =Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *= (or specific domain)
- =Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT=
- =Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization=

*Example scenario:*
Website at =https://example.com= wants to fetch data from =https://api.other.com= - CORS headers from the API server determine if this is allowed.

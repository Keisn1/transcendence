#+startup: overview

- reusable UI components
  - reuse buttons, cards, avatar components etc. throughout your application

- uses a virtual DOM
  - can update and render components independently
  - original javascript requires direct manipulation of the DOM

- manages state of the application
  - state: data that determines how a component renders/behaves

* Components
- building blocks of React applications
- allow developers to break down UI into manageable pieces
** functional
- more modern
- javascript-functions which return elements that describe the UI
** class-based
* JSX
- syntax extension for Java Script which resembles HTML
- allows a more declarative way

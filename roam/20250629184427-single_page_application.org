#+startup: overview

An application that loads a single HTML pages and updates the contents dynamically rather then loading new pages from the server.

What makes an application a SPA:
- subsequent page updates happen via JavaScript
- navigation in between different pages doesn't trigger a full page reload
- uses [[id:4dede980-9343-4ed3-9089-34b057b07a30][AJAX/fetch]] to communicate with the server for data

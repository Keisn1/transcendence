* TODO Frontend
- [X] typify navbar

  - [[file:~/workspace/transcendence/chats/component_based_architecture.org::*when do i destroy views?][when do i destroy views?]]
- [X] refresh view with new content from the server

- [ ] why does adlightbox does not show up when you return to the dashboard
  - there is a reason for this [[file:src/components/adLightbox/adLightbox.ts::window.removeEventListener("load", showAdAfterTimeout); // only initially page load]]
  - it's only when the page is loaded ("load" event)

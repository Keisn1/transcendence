#+title: module code generation method
#+date: [2025-07-01 Tue 13:35]
#+startup: overview

- refers to how modules are transformed and executed in certain environments
- concerned with how modules are imported and exported
- concerned with how modules are loaded and executed

* ECMAScript Modules (ESM):
Modern JavaScript uses ESM, which allows you to use =import= and =export= statements. This method is supported natively in modern browsers and Node.js (starting with version 12 and fully stabilized in version 14).
- Importing:
  #+begin_src javascript
import { something } from './module.js';
import defaultExport from './module.js';
  #+end_src
- Exporting:
  #+begin_src javascript
export const something = ...;
export default someValue;
  #+end_src

* CommonJS
- This is the module system used by Node.js
- uses =require()= to import modules and =module.exports= to export them
- CommonJS is synchronous

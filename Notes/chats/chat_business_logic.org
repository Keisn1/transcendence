*** We are building a single-page application that will host a Pong game with the following features
- user management, some elaborate monitoring
- frontend with TailwindCSS
- Remote Player (playing pong game remotely from different computers)
- Chat (chat inbetween players)
- Security
  - WAF/ModSecurity/HashiCorp
  - 2FA + JWT
- GDPR (anonymization)
- Microservices
- Prometheus and Grafana
- Infrastructure Setup with ELK

I'm trying to figure out the core business logic of this application



Here's the core business logic for your Pong application:

**** Game Engine
- *Game State Management*: Position tracking, collision detection, scoring
- *Real-time Synchronization*: WebSocket connections for paddle/ball updates
- *Game Session Lifecycle*: Start, pause, end, reconnection handling
- *Physics Engine*: Ball movement, paddle physics, boundary detection

**** User Management
- *Authentication Flow*: Registration, login, 2FA verification
- *Player Profiles*: Stats, rankings, game history
- *Session Management*: JWT token handling, refresh logic
- *GDPR Compliance*: Data anonymization, deletion requests

**** Matchmaking
- *Player Queuing*: Find opponents, skill-based matching
- *Room Management*: Create/join game rooms
- *Spectator Mode*: Allow others to watch games

**** Communication
- *Real-time Chat*: In-game messaging, lobby chat
- *Game Events*: Score updates, game state broadcasts
- *Notifications*: Match found, game invites

**** Core Services (Microservices)
- *Auth Service*: User authentication, 2FA
- *Game Service*: Game logic, state management
- *Chat Service*: Messaging, moderation
- *User Service*: Profile management, GDPR
- *Analytics Service*: Game stats, monitoring

**** Data Flow
- Frontend ↔ API Gateway ↔ Microservices
- WebSocket connections for real-time game/chat
- Event-driven architecture for game state changes

The business logic centers around managing real-time multiplayer game sessions while handling user interactions securely.

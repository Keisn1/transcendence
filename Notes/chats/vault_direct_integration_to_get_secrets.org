*** Looking at my setup with HashiCorp vault, what do you think?

Your HashiCorp Vault setup looks quite sophisticated! Here are my thoughts:

*Strengths:*
- Good security practices: AppRole authentication, secret templating, non-root user in containers
- Proper secret management with Vault Agent for automatic secret retrieval
- SSL/TLS certificates managed through Vault
- Health checks and graceful shutdown handling
- Secrets mounted as read-only volumes

*Areas for improvement:*

1. *SSL key permissions*: You changed from =0600= to =0644= for the SSL key - this is less secure. Private keys should be =0600=.

2. *Development mode*: Using Vault in dev mode (=-dev=) isn't suitable for production. Consider using a proper Vault configuration file.

3. *Secret rotation*: No automatic secret rotation mechanism visible.

4. *Backup strategy*: No backup configuration for Vault data.

5. *Monitoring*: Missing Vault audit logging and monitoring setup.

*Quick fixes:*
- Revert SSL key perms to =0600=
- Add Vault audit logging
- Consider using Vault's database secrets engine for dynamic DB credentials
- Add resource limits to containers

Overall, it's a solid foundation for a microservices architecture with proper secret management! The Vault Agent pattern is particularly well implemented.

*** My concern is how i deploy the auth service seperately from the vault service. As far as i can see, the auth-service needs to be deployed together (same server-enviroenment) as the auth-vault-agent. The auth-vault-agent on the other hand depends on the vault-init and this again depends on vault condition: service_healthy. Do you see where i'm getting at? Help me understand

Ah, I see your concern! You've identified a key architectural challenge. Your current setup creates a *tight coupling* between services that should be independently deployable. Let me break down the dependency chain:

#+begin_src
vault → vault-init → auth-vault-agent → auth-service
#+end_src

This means you can't deploy =auth-service= independently because it needs the entire Vault infrastructure running first.

*Better approaches:*

1. *Sidecar Pattern* (Kubernetes-style):
#+begin_src yaml
# Deploy auth-service with its own vault-agent sidecar
auth-service:
  # Your auth service
vault-agent-sidecar:
  # Vault agent running alongside auth-service
#+end_src

2. *External Vault Agent* (Separate deployment):
#+begin_src yaml
# Deploy vault-agent as a separate service
vault-agent:
  image: hashicorp/vault:1.20.0
  # Writes secrets to shared volume/external store

auth-service:
  # Reads secrets from shared location
  depends_on:
    - vault-agent  # Only this dependency
#+end_src

3. *Direct Vault Integration* (Most flexible):
#+begin_src javascript
// In your auth service
const vault = require('node-vault');
const vaultClient = vault({
  apiVersion: 'v1',
  endpoint: process.env.VAULT_ADDR
});

// Authenticate and fetch secrets directly
#+end_src

4. *Init Container Pattern*:
#+begin_src yaml
auth-service:
  init_containers:
    - name: vault-init
      # Fetches secrets once, then exits
  containers:
    - name: auth-service
      # Starts after init container succeeds
#+end_src

*Recommendation:* Use approach #3 (direct integration) or #4 (init container) for true service independence. This lets you deploy =auth-service= to any environment as long as it can reach Vault.

*** I would like to know how approach #3 looks like in code. Please be concise, I don't need the whole files, I only need to understand how the thing works

Here's how approach #3 works in code:

*Install Vault client:*
#+begin_src bash
npm install node-vault
#+end_src

*Modified app.js (key parts):*
#+begin_src javascript
const vault = require('node-vault');

// Initialize Vault client
const vaultClient = vault({
  apiVersion: 'v1',
  endpoint: process.env.VAULT_ADDR || 'http://vault:8200'
});

// Authenticate with AppRole
async function authenticateVault() {
  const response = await vaultClient.approleLogin({
    role_id: process.env.VAULT_ROLE_ID,
    secret_id: process.env.VAULT_SECRET_ID
  });

  vaultClient.token = response.auth.client_token;
  return response;
}

// Fetch secrets directly
async function getSecrets() {
  await authenticateVault();

  const [dbConfig, authConfig, sslCerts] = await Promise.all([
    vaultClient.read('secret/data/database'),
    vaultClient.read('secret/data/auth-config'),
    vaultClient.read('secret/data/ssl-certs')
  ]);

  return {
    database: dbConfig.data.data,
    auth: authConfig.data.data,
    ssl: sslCerts.data.data
  };
}

async function startServer() {
  const secrets = await getSecrets();

  // Use secrets directly - no file waiting needed!
  const app = fastify({
    https: {
      key: secrets.ssl.key,
      cert: secrets.ssl.cert,
      ca: secrets.ssl.ca
    }
  });
  // ... rest of server setup
}
#+end_src

*Environment variables:*
#+begin_src bash
VAULT_ADDR=http://vault:8200
VAULT_ROLE_ID=your-role-id
VAULT_SECRET_ID=your-secret-id
#+end_src

*Key benefits:*
- No Vault Agent needed
- Service can deploy independently
- Direct API communication with Vault
- Can implement token renewal/refresh logic

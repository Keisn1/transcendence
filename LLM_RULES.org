#+title: LLM Rules

* LLM Rules
Please follow these rules for our entire conversation:

*Be aware that you are writing into emacs org-mode*
- don't use markdown markup (double ** etc.)
- use org mode Document structure (headlines, plain lists)

*Conciseness Rules:*
- Keep responses brief and to-the-point
- Avoid lengthy explanations unless specifically requested
- Don't repeat information already established in the conversation

*Code/File Modification Rules:*
- Only show the specific lines/sections that need to be changed
- Use diff-style format or clear "change this section" indicators
- Never reproduce entire files unless explicitly asked
- Focus on what to modify, not what stays the same

*Architectural Approach Rules:*
- When asked for alternative approaches, present the complete new solution
- Don't show incremental changes from the previous approach
- Treat each architectural request as a fresh design question
- Provide the full picture of the new approach in one response

*Clarification:*
- If unsure whether you want changes or a new approach, ask for clarification
- "Changes" = modifications to existing code/structure
- "Approach/Alternative" = complete new solution presentation

*Explanation Rule:*
When asked for an explanation:
1. **Include code examples** - Provide practical, working code snippets that demonstrate the concept (inside org-structure-templates)
2. **Use metaphors** - Relate technical concepts to real-world analogies to make them more intuitive
3. **Add a "For Dummies" section** - Include a simplified explanation using plain language, avoiding jargon
4. Structure as: Explanation → Code examples → Metaphors → For Dummies section
* UserStory prompt`
I've developed this frontend for a ponggame and I now want to implement this user story
#+begin_example
As a registered user of the website, I want to be able to navigate to my profile, where I can see my Username, my email and my avatar, so I can individualize my appearance on the website.
#+end_example
I want to continue my established structure. Please guide me through that.
